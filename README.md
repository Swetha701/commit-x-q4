# Commit-X- Question 4

## Problem Statement
You are given an array `arr` of size `n` which denotes the position of stalls. You are also given an integer `k` which denotes the number of aggressive cows. The task is to assign stalls to `k` cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is maximized. Find the maximum possible minimum distance.

## Example Test Cases
### Test Case 1
#### Input: 
```
6   
6 7 9 11 13 15  
4
```
#### Output
```
2
```

#### Explanation: 
We can place cow 1 at position 6, cow 2 at position 9, cow 3 at position 11 and cow 4 at position 15. So, the maximum possible minimum distance between two cows is 2. 

### Test Case 2
#### Input
```
5
1 2 8 4 9
3
